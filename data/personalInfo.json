  "secondPara": "Growing up, I was always engaged by two worlds: the internet beyond my living room computer, and my family's mechanical engineering background. After a childhood of working under the hood of drag cars, I now work under the hood of React, Node, and any other web technologies that help us create amazing applications in this new world of engineering. I hold a great passion for learning new technologies and techniques, solving complex problems, and developing solutions to avoid future issues.",
  "thirdPara": "In my free time, I can be found jamming out to music, preparing for my next DJ set, cooking anything that sounds delicious, exploring the many number of ramen resturants in my area, hiking the nearby mountains, or simply having a few gin and tonics with my friends."
